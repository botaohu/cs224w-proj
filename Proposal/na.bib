@article{Bayati2009,
abstract = {We propose a new distributed algorithm for sparse variants of the network alignment problem, which occurs in a variety of data mining areas including systems biology, database matching, and computer vision. Our algorithm uses a belief propagation heuristic and provides near optimal solutions for this NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. We show that our algorithm is faster and outperforms or ties existing algorithms on synthetic problems, a problem in bioinformatics, and a problem in ontology matching. We also provide a unified framework for studying and comparing all network alignment solvers.},
